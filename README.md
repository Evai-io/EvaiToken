## What is Evai.io?
Evai.io is a world-class rating system for cryptocurrencies that anyone can use to evaluate this new asset class. Through a combination of peer-reviewed financial research and economic modelling, Evai provides decentralised and impartial ratings based on a multi-factor AI & ML model, which negates human intervention.

## EVAI token 
The EVAI token is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 standard token built upon a Turing complete smart contract. By conforming to the ERC20 token standard, the EVAI token is compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure, such as wallets and exchanges.
Evai provides incentives to holders via an index tracker fund, staking pool, commercial APIs and much more.

**BEP-20 compatibility** 

Evai has taken steps to ensure compatibility between the EVAI Token and BSC. In doing so, weâ€™ve opened up an entire wealth of future collaborative possibilities, including facilitating the seamless transfers of value between Evai and the Binance Smart Chain as well as any protocols and platforms supporting those standards.

## Under Development
The following features are still under development and therefore not yet available:
A distributed token-based voting mechanism will be implemented for constituents to use their EVAI tokens to propose changes and vote on the direction of platform development. Token holders will be able to vote for or against proposals. Once the proposal reaches a predefined threshold, the vote passes or fails, and appropriate corresponding actions are taken.

**Feedback?**

We're actively working on progressing platform development and expanding our documentation. If you have any suggestions for future updates or improvements, we'd love to hear from you. Let us know in the official [Evai.io Telegram group.](https://t.me/EVAIofficial)
